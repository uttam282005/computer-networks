# defining requirements

different network perspectives-
- consumer of network -> needs fast and consistent experience
- application developer ->  a guarantee that each message the application sends will be delivered without error within a certain amount of time or the ability to switch gracefully among different connections to the network as the user moves around.
- network manager -> easy to maintain, expand (modular)

# scalability connectivity
- A system that is designed to support growth to an arbitrarily large size is said to scale

at the lowest level, connectivity can be physical 
where two or more computers (nodes) are connected to each other by a physical medium (called link)

switched networks solves the problem of unmanagable wires coming out from a node 
by providing indirect connection between two nodes via switches.

## two types of switches-
- circuit switches 
- packet switches
